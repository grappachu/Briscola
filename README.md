# Briscola

A simple game for "Italian Briscola" made with a TDD approach.

## About the project

The purpose of this project is to improve use of TDD development in a company-context. 

Every developer can contribute by implementing his own strategy and sign-up for the tournament against others.

With this code you can:

- Play in a 2 player game (human vs. robot)
- Play in a 4 players game (human + robot vs. robot + robot)
- Compare two robots in a direct match
- Run a tournaments to check the strongest robot

The strategy code is open so there's no secrets, just ideas...
